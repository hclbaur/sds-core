# Welcome back

After writing down the SDA specification in 2008, I spent some time 
implementing it in Java, as a general-purpose library. In the next couple of 
years, I occasionally returned to the subject, until ~~I lost interest~~ 
other interests found me.

Then in 2020 (woah, was that time whizzing past?) I rediscovered the zip 
files I kept, started toying around with the sources, created a git project 
and polished everything up a little.

Not long after I was close to something that could be used to parse, render 
and manipulate data, so I tagged it SDA 1.3.0 - which is rather silly because 
no one was using it - and started thinking about the future.

Which, naturally, would have to include Structured (Simple) Data Schema.

lockdowns I got to spent quite some free evenings on SDS.
